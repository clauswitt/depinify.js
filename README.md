depinify.js
===========

Clone + npm install + grunt test

This is a demo implementation of how you can get parameters from a defined function, by utilising Function.prototype.toString, which returns the source code of the given function. By using regular expressions, you can extract the parameters the function was defined with, at runtime. 

I dont know if this is how angular does things?
